## Mouse Project

Data are from <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression#> by `Ahmed, M.M., Dhanasekaran, A.R., Block, A., Tong, S., Costa, A.C., Stasko, M. and Gardiner, K.J., 2015. Protein dynamics associated with failed and rescued learning in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome. PloS one, 10(3), p.e0119491.`

There are 6 parts:
1. Load Data and EDA

2. Description

3. BDNF_N difference

4. ERBB4_N linear model

5. PCA

6. Differential expression

In the end we found differential-expressed proteins.
